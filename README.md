Tic-tac-toe is a paper-and-pencil game for two players where the goal is to be the first to get three of their marks in a row
How to play
Players take turns marking a 3-by-3 grid with either an X or an O. The winner is the first player to get three marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game ends in a tie if no player has three marks in a row after all nine squares are filled
